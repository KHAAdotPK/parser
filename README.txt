Parser
This repository contains a single C++ file that defines an abstract Parser class.

Dependencies
The Parser class has a single dependency: the string library, which can be found at https://github.com/KHAAdotPK/string.git

Usage
To use this Parser class in your project, simply include the parser.h header file and create a class that inherits from Parser. You can then implement the pure virtual functions defined in the Parser class to provide custom parsing functionality.
